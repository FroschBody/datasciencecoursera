##Course Learnings
==========

### for coursework in The Data Scientist's Toolbox MOOC

I hope to sucessfully complete the Data Scientist Toolbox course and the Data Scientist specialisation.
This is my first effort at using GitHub and my first real exposure to programming

This file keeps track of what I have learned. It is possible that as time goes by this file will be usable as an index that can be searched and find where in the course different topics were covered.

So far I have learned:

Week 1
* Information about the course objectives
* overview of other courses in the specialisation

Week 2
* How to set up Git
* How to set up GitHub and create a repo
* repo is short for repository
* create forks, make changes, move things from local system to remote system
* merge forks
* Some simple markdown editing techniques such as headings and lists
* In order to push a fork from desktop to github use command: git push origin <branch name>
* How to Install packages


Thanks for your interest.
